## Phase 3: Structural Improvements (2-4 hours)

**Goal**: Fix module organization and domain boundaries
**Impact**: Clearer architecture, improved discoverability

### 3.1 Merge Settlement Modules (CRITICAL)

**Preparation**:

- [x] Create detailed migration plan for import paths
- [x] Document current usage of both modules

**Merge Structure**:

- [x] Create new unified structure in `src/modules/settlements/`:
  - [x] Create `engine/` directory (pure math layer)
  - [x] Move `settlement/calculate-balances.ts` → `settlements/engine/`
  - [x] Move `settlement/normalize-shares.ts` → `settlements/engine/`
  - [x] Move `settlement/optimize-settlements.ts` → `settlements/engine/`
  - [x] Keep `service/` directory (data integration layer)
  - [x] Move `settlement/service/SettlementService.ts` → `settlements/service/`
  - [x] Move `settlement/service/DisplayCurrencyAdapter.ts` → `settlements/service/`
  - [x] Keep existing `repository/` directory (transaction records)
  - [x] Merge `hooks/` directories
  - [x] Merge `screens/` directories
  - [x] Merge `components/` directories
  - [x] Merge `types.ts` files
  - [x] Merge `__tests__/` directories

**Update Imports**:

- [x] Search codebase for `@modules/settlement` imports (without 's')
- [x] Update all imports to `@modules/settlements`
- [x] Update path aliases if needed in `tsconfig.json` (not needed - working correctly)

**Cleanup**:

- [x] Delete old `src/modules/settlement/` directory
- [x] Run tests to verify no regressions (83 tests passing)
- [x] Run `npm run type-check` (0 errors)
- [x] Update documentation in CLAUDE.md if needed (not needed - path alias already correct)

### 3.2 Relocate Misplaced Hooks

**Move use-device-owner**:

- [x] Create `src/modules/onboarding/hooks/` directory (already existed)
- [x] Move `src/hooks/use-device-owner.ts` → `src/modules/onboarding/hooks/`
- [x] Update imports across codebase (app/settings.tsx, create-trip-screen.tsx)
- [x] Update `src/modules/onboarding/hooks/index.ts` exports

**Move use-display-currency**:

- [x] Created new `settings/` module for user preferences
- [x] Move `src/hooks/use-display-currency.ts` → `src/modules/settings/hooks/`
- [x] Update imports across codebase (4 screens updated)
- [x] Created module exports (settings/hooks/index.ts, settings/index.ts)

**Update Global Hooks**:

- [x] Update `src/hooks/index.ts` to remove relocated hooks
- [x] Verified only cross-cutting hooks remain (`use-query`, `use-refresh-control`)
- [x] Note: `use-mutation` was never in global hooks (belongs in modules)

### 3.3 Add Common Styles to Theme
